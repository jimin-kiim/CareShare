Nowadays, the number of registered disabled people is 2.62 million, and as of 2021, the number of elderly people aged 65 or older is 8.53 million. 
This is the story of our country now. Most of them need medical assistive devices for their daily lives, but due to the high price range of medical aids, 
many people need support to use them. However, there are many people who are not getting medical aids support service because they do not know how to apply.

CareShare is a platform designed for them. It aims to reduce the financial burden of using unused medical aids by renting, sharing, and trading. 
It also includes functions such as collecting information about medical support services and comparing prices of medical aids on the market.
